    <!-- First paragraph explaining Time Complexity -->
    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time it takes for an algorithm to run as a function of the input size. 
        A more efficient algorithm has lower time complexity, meaning it performs better with larger inputs. 
        Analyzing time complexity helps in determining how scalable and efficient an algorithm is.
    </p>

    <!-- Second paragraph explaining Space Complexity with bold text -->
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs in relation to the input size. It measures the extra space or memory required by the algorithm. 
        For instance, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) uses memory that grows linearly with the input size.
